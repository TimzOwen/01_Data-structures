## Queues:

Uses the __*FIFO*__ architecture to __*pop*__ and __*push*__ elements in a queue

__Lists__ are used to work with queues but not recommended, maybe for 

testing

When adding elements in an array, Queue uses: 

    back  -----> Front  [ index]

There are 4 types of queues:

    1. Simple queue --> Follows FIFO rule

    2. Circular queue --> rear and front connected

    3. priority queue --> removal are based on priority

    4. Dequeue (Double ended) --> insertion/deletion at both ends
